The index is calculated as the negative sum of the product of the proportion of each species and the logarithm of that proportion. If practically all abundance is concentrated to one type, and the other types are very rare (even if there are many of them), Shannon entropy approaches zero. When there is only one type in the dataset, Shannon entropy exactly equals zero. The clones are identified by aa and both chain(s) was/were used.",
